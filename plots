Step 1: Look for outliers and sudden shifts
Step 2: Look for trends
Step 3: Look for seasonal patterns or cyclic movements
Step 4: Assess whether seasonal changes are additive or multiplicative
Additive changes
In this example of additive seasonal changes, the data values tend to increase over time, but the magnitude of the seasonal change remains the same.
Multiplicative changes
In this example of multiplicative seasonal changes, the magnitude of the seasonal change increases over time as the data values increase.
